This project leverages the power of machine learning to identify different types of flowers in real-time through a webcam. 
The model was trained using Google's Teachable Machine platform, which provides an easy-to-use interface\
for training image classification models.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to classify objects (flowers) 
efficiently and interactively. It serves as an educational tool to showcase the capabilities of image classification models.

Features
Webcam Integration: Uses a webcam to capture live images for classification.

Real-Time Predictions: Displays the probabilities and classifications of different flower types in real-time.

Simple UI: A button to start the webcam and a display area for results.

Responsive Design: Clean and user-friendly interface.
